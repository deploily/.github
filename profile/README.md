# Deploily

Based in Ain Temouchent, TransformaTek is developing an innovative cloud proxy solution to revolutionize application deployment for startups. Our goal? To simplify deployments while providing local alternatives to expensive foreign APIs like Google Maps.

To ensure compliance with Algerian data protection regulations, we're seeking strategic partnerships with national cloud providers. This will enable us to offer local hosting alongside redundant systems that guarantee high availability and scalability for our clients.

ðŸ’¡ With our platform, clients can choose cloud services from multiple national providers. Deploily takes care of deploying a multi-cloud Kubernetes cluster, ensuring uninterrupted service.
ðŸŽ‰ Open Source for the Community

We believe in collaboration and innovation. That's why Deploily will be fully open sourceâ€”empowering the Algerian tech community to thrive!
